<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>A Recent computer science Graduate from Seattle University. My goal is to excel in my current computer science field.
  I am really passionate about software in general. I have worked on Data Structure and Algorithms and have built
  applications from the ground-up and made it through deployment after breaking and fixing thousands of lines of code.
